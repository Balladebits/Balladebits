You can Call me Ballade sweetie,Nice to meet you

I'm a He/Him

I'm a pseudointrovert (Potentially asocial) but like Joking and cuddling around ppl who likes it

Yeah i Know,i look like i'm always AFK but no,come and say hi,maybe i'll notice You ^^

Also, i'm Straight (with bisexual tendencies) and already taken (still can erp tho- since is virtual and fictive and not a real thing)

Despite being like that i don't trust ppl so easily,and also aside from being a literal clown sometimes,please don't push my limits if i tell you to stop,okay? 

Please do not copy or inspo my Skins

I roam around the docks or the Cafe and frequently join parties

Minors and aromantic people please DNI (no,i do not hate Aromantic,it's because i'm a cuddler and i prefer not making them uncomfortable)

I speak Both Spanish and English (Mostly english,but i really love speaking native spanish if you feel like it <3)
